# Learning-Docker-and-kubernetes
Enhance knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes

## To learn Docker and Kubernetes, hereâ€™s a concise roadmap you can follow:

### Docker Basics
- Understand Containers: Read about containerization and how it differs from virtual machines.
- Install Docker: Set up Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine for Linux).
- Learn Docker Commands:
```
Basics: docker run, docker ps, docker stop, docker rm.
Images: docker build, docker pull, docker images.
```
- Containers: docker start, docker exec, docker logs.
- Dockerfile: Learn to write a Dockerfile to create custom images.
- Docker Compose: Use docker-compose to manage multi-container applications.

- Intermediate Docker
+ Volumes and Networks: Explore data persistence with volumes and manage communication with networks.- 
+ Environment Variables and Secrets: Learn to pass configuration securely.
+ Image Optimization: Use multi-stage builds for smaller, efficient images.

### Kubernetes Basics
- Core Concepts: Learn Pods, Nodes, Clusters, and Namespaces.
- Kubernetes Installation: Use Minikube for local testing or try a managed K8s service (e.g., GKE, EKS).
- Kubectl Commands:
  - Basic Commands: kubectl get, kubectl describe, kubectl apply.
- Managing Pods: kubectl logs, kubectl exec.
- YAML Configs: Learn to define Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps in YAML.
- Intermediate Kubernetes
  - Networking: Explore Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer) and Ingress for external access.
  - ConfigMaps and Secrets: Store environment-specific configurations securely.
  - Scaling and Autoscaling: Set up replica sets, scaling policies, and resource limits.
  - Persistent Storage: Understand PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
- Advanced Topics
  - Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) and logging (ELK Stack).
  - Helm: Manage Kubernetes applications with Helm charts.
  - CI/CD with Docker and Kubernetes: Set up pipelines to automate builds, tests, and deployments.
